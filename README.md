# JavaGameEngine3D [Aborted]
A from-scratch 3D game engine written with only the help of the LWJGL to allow access to OpenGL.

This is a personal project of mine, adapted from my previous attempt at a C++ game engine (which I aborted due to acquiring a new computer), inspired by the work and tutorials of Jamie King (https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja) and Benny from thebennybox (https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox, https://github.com/BennyQBD).

I originally thought that re-writing my engine in Java would be easy... but OpenGL using Java really sucks and I didn't want to do it anymore. Hoorah for C++!!
