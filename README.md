# JavaGameEngine3D
A from-scratch 3D game engine written with only the help of the LWJGL to allow access to OpenGL.

This is a personal project of mine, adapted from my previous attempt at a C++ game engine (which I had to abort due to acquiring a new computer), inspired by the work and tutorials of Jamie King (https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja) and Benny from thebennybox (https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox, https://github.com/BennyQBD).
