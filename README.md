# JavaGameEngine3D
A from-scratch 3D game engine written with only the help of the LWJGL to allow access to OpenGL.

This is a personal project of mine, adapted from my previous attempt at a C++ game engine (which I had to abort due to acquiring a new computer), inspired by the work and tutorials of Jamie King (https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja) and Benny from thebennybox (https://www.youtube.com/user/thebennybox, https://github.com/BennyQBD).

## Why do I do this?
When I tell people about this project, I often hear them say, "You know, you could always just download Unity or UDK and use that to make games... Why you gotta go and write your own?" So really, why the hell am I doing this?

I'm not making a game engine so that I can make games. Sure, once it's done, I'll be able to do that if I want, but that's not what it's about. It's about the learning experience and the sense of accomplishment that comes with being able to write something from scratch. Sure, it'll never ever be the most efficient or groundbreaking or innovative game engine, but it'll be mine. I think that's pretty damn cool.

## Why Java?
"Bro, don't you know that C++ is *lightyears* faster than Java??"

Indeed, that is what I thought when originally writing this game engine. However, recently, I purchased a new computer. It is a Macbook. I had been working on my game engine in Microsoft Visual Studio. MSVS is not available for Mac. So I was put down by this. But then I came around to thinking more about cross-platform operability, and thought that Java would be a viable and easier option to transition my work to. Additionally, in the wise words of thebennybox, "Writing things in C++ does not automagically make them faster." In order for me to really see the benefit of using C++ over Java, I would have to know a lot more than I do. In other words, I am not professional enough to know how to fully utilize C++ to make a noticable difference in performance. Finally, the benefit of losing all the nasty headaches and hand cramps that result from C++ coding... Definitely worth it in my book.
